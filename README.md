# Automating Invoicing to  Students
## Overview
The goal for this program was to create personalised invoices from a template, save, convert to word document invoice to pdf, and email to students.
## What I learned/Challenges I faced
* Read up on documentation understanding how to use the docx library (creating and altering word documents with python)
* Attaching documents to files using MIME Multipart library.
* Sending emails with python using smtplib
* Handling dataframes with pandas
* Dealing with the datetime module (formatting the date in particular ways)
* Formatting number data into 2 decimal places.
